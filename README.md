# The Modest Style Guide

Modest fashion is more than a trend â€” itâ€™s a lifestyle rooted in elegance, intention, and timeless beauty.

At **Norah Collections**, we create pieces that reflect these values. Whether youâ€™re styling a casual abaya or layering for formal events, our collections help you express modesty with confidence.

## Style Tips:
- Pair open abayas with neutral innerwear for a clean silhouette
- Use soft belts or sashes to define your shape without compromising coverage
- Stick to earthy, flowy tones for a sophisticated everyday look

Our designs are made to flow effortlessly, blend tradition with modern flair, and stay true to who you are.
